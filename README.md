# MatLab-ENS336-NN-StockPrediction
Overview
This project explores the use of neural networks for stock price prediction. Leveraging MATLAB‚Äôs feedforwardnet, we train a model on historical stock data to forecast future prices. The aim is to highlight how machine learning‚Äîespecially deep learning‚Äîcan uncover complex patterns in time-series financial data.

üß† Technologies Used
MATLAB for model development, training, and visualization

Feedforward Neural Network for regression

Data Preprocessing: Normalization, Moving Averages (SMA/EMA)

Performance Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Regression Plots

üìä Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalizes raw stock data and calculates moving averages to reduce noise.

Feedforward Neural Network: Built with 10 hidden neurons using the traingdx algorithm.

Visualization Tools:

Training performance curves

Actual vs. predicted stock price graphs

Real-time scatter updates

Error histograms and regression analysis

Model Evaluation:

Tracks MSE across training, validation, and testing

Visualizes overfitting or convergence using validation checks
